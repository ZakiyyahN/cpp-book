# 1.1 Introduction to Problem Solving
To understand the concept of problem solving, let us first consider a problem.

**Problem:** Suppose John has a racing car and he wishes to improve its speed. 
In what ways can he solve this problem?

</p>

**Step 1:** Find the origin of the problem. Is the root of the problem the engine, gravity or the wind?
>Let us suppose the root of the problem was the engine.

**Step 2:** Search for possible solutions. The following measures may improve the speed of a racing car:
 1. Change the engine (Jet)    
 2. Improve the engine    
 3. Change the fuel
 
**Step 3:** Implement the top solutions.
 >John decides to go forth with: Change the engine (jet) and Change the fuel. He implements the two solutions he chose.

**Step 4:** Evaluate the implemented solutions and choose the solution which is best.
>John evaluates the implemented solutions and finds out that changing the jet is more efficient in improving the racing speed of his car.

The following picture summarizes the concept of problem solving.

In Memory

## 1.3.2 Computer Memory
Computers have two types of main memory: Main Memory and the Secondary Memory (Backing Store). [^memory]

### 1.3.2.1 **Main Memory**
Main memory is also known as **primary storage**. Main memory refers to storage locations that are directly accessible by the CPU. This implies that data and instructions found in the main memory are directly accessible by the CPU.

Main Memory includes:
- RAM (Random Access Memory)
- ROM (Read-only Memory)
- Cache Memory 
- Registers

#### **RAM - Random Access Memory**
The RAM inside a computer holds all of the data and instructions that are currently being processed. In order for any program to be executed, it must first be loaded into the RAM from Secondary storage. This is because RAM has quicker read and write speeds than secondary storage devices. The processor will fetch instructions (and any necessary data) from the RAM directly before decoding and executing them.

##### RAM Characteristics
- *Random Access:* Any location can be accessed *"at random"* with no impact on speed. This means that any location can be accessed in the same amount of time, unlike other storage devices where a sensor (such as a read/write head) needs to be moved into place
- *Volatile:* If the power goes off, the contents of RAM are lost.
- *Lower capacity* than secondary storage devices but highest storage capacity when compared to other forms of Main Memory.
- *quicker access time* compared to secondary storage.

</p>

#### **ROM - Read Only Memory**
ROM is typically used to store the boot sequence (BIOS- Basic Input Output System) for a computer. The contents of ROM are set by the computer manufacturer and, as the name implies, your computer usually only reads from ROM. 

The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) stored on ROM is a very limited sequence of instructions that checks that the core components of the computer system (RAM, fundamental input/output devices, secondary storage) are connected and responding correctly.

Once done, the boot sequence loads the essential parts of the main operating system from secondary storage into RAM. From this point, the operating system will oversee the operation of the computer, managing memory, storage, and requests for input/output.

##### **ROM Characteristics**
- Stores the *BIOS.*
- *Non-Volatile:* If the power goes off, the contents of ROM are lost.
- *Lower capacity* than RAM.


To learn more about different types of ROM and RAM, you can do some further reading on [here.](https://eng.libretexts.org/Courses/Delta_College/Operating_System%3A_The_Basics/07%3A_Memory/7.01%3A_Random_Access_Memory_(RAM)_and_Read_Only_Memory_(ROM))

</p>

#### **Cache Memory**
Whilst a program is being executed, the processor stores and retrieves data from the RAM repeatedly, and although RAM is quick to access, there is another type of memory designed to make access to frequently used data much faster: cache memory (pronounced cash).

#### **Registers**
Registers are very small memory devices which provide faster access than both the RAM and cache, but are only able to hold a few bytes at most.

There are two types of registers:
- *General Purpose Registers:* These registers are used to temporarily store values generated by instructions. 

- *Special-purpose registers:* There are special purpose registers which are used in the fetch-decode-execute cycle in the Von Neumann Architechture (link to more info about Von Neumann).

### 1.3.2.2 Secondary Memory
Main memory is used to store data and instructions being used during processing. What is the purpose of secondary memory?
Secondary memory, also known as backing store, provides permanent storage for data files and application. 

##### **Secondary Storage Characteristics**
- *Low cost* compared to Main Memory
- *Non-volatile* implying that data is preserved despited power outage.
- Can be divided into four categories including:
  - - *Magnetic Storage:* e.g. Hard disk drive, Floppy disk.
  - - *Solid-state disk:* e.g. CD/DVD-ROM, CD/DVR-R, CD/DVD-RW.
  - - *Optical Storage:* e.g. USB pen drives, SD cards.
  - - *Virtual Storage:* e.g. Cloud storage.

#### Summary: Computer Memory

The figure below shows an inverse relationship between the cost and size of computer memory and a positive relationship between the speed and cost of computer memory. If a user wishes to have faster access to the contents stored in memory, they will have to spend more money on the memory storage medium and will obtain a lower storage size compared to other memory storage devices with less memory access time.

Registers are the smallest memory storage devices with the fastest access time but they are also the most expensive.

 #### Data Storage in Memory
 Data is stored in terms of bits. The term *bit* derives its name from the phrase 'binary digit.' A bit consists of either a '0' or a '1.' The value '0' is usually associated to a state of *off* while the value of '1' is usually associated with a state of *on.*

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/img/book/c1/bit.png" alt="Binary Digit">
</p>

A byte consists of 8 bits. Example: 10011010
<p align="center">
<img src="assets/img/book/c1/byte.png" alt="Byte">
</p>

We have learnt about different types of memory. We just learnt that data and instructions are stored as bytes in memory locations. Below is a visual depiction of how information is stored in memory. Each memory location can be accessed via the memory address. The address is unique to each memory location.

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/img/book/c1/location.png" alt="Memory Location">
</p>

#### Food for thought: Suppose we wish to replace the contents of memory location 2 with *11111111.* How will our memory look?

The current content of a memory location is lost whenever new information is placed in it. This implies that the current byte in memory location 2 is overwritten from '01010101
' to '11111111.'

## 1.3.3 The Motherboard - The main circuit board
The motherboard is mounted inside a case and is securely attached via small screws through pre-drilled holes. Motherboard contains ports to connect all of the internal components.[^motherboard]
- It provides a single socket for CPU, whereas for memory, normally one or more slots are available. 
- Motherboards provide ports to attach the floppy drive, hard drive, and optical drives via ribbon cables. 
- Motherboard carries fans and a special port designed for power supply.
- There is a peripheral card slot in front of the motherboard using which video cards, sound cards, and other expansion cards can be connected to the motherboard.
- There are several ports on the left side to connect the monitor, printer, mouse, keyboard, speaker, and network cables. 
- Motherboards also provide USB ports, which allow compatible devices to be connected in plug-in/plug-out fashion. For example, pen drive, digital cameras, etc.

Some popular motherboard manufacturers include: Intel, ASUS, AOpen, ABIT, Biostar, Gigabyte and MSI among others.

## 1.3.4 CPU - Central Processing Unit
CPU stands for Central Processing Unit and is also known as the processor. The CPU is famously known as the brain of the computer. The main purpose of the CPU is to execute program instructions.

At the hardware level, a CPU is an integrated circuit, also known as a chip. An integrated circuit "integrates" millions or billions of tiny electrical parts, arranging them into circuits and fitting them all into a compact box. [^CPU] The CPU is then inserted into the CPU socket on the motherboard.

The main components of the CPU include:
- The *Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)* - to perform arithmetic (Addition, Sustraction) and logical (AND, OR, NOT) operations. 
- The *Control Unit* - to control operations of all parts of the computer.
- The Storage unit - to hold data and instructions being executed.

### CPU Performance
The performance of the CPU depends mainly on the following factors:
- Clock  Speed
- Number  of  Cores
- CPU cache

</p>


#### Clock Speed
A computer’s processor clock speed determines how quickly the central processing unit (CPU) can retrieve and interpret instructions. Clock speeds are measured in gigahertz (GHz), with a higher number equating to higher clock speed. Faster clock speeds mean that you’ll see tasks ordered from your CPU completed quicker, making your experience seamless and reducing the time you wait to interface with your favorite applications and programs.[^clock]
<br>

| **Measure** | **Conversion**  | **Explanation**
|--|--|--|
| Hertz |1 Hz  | One cycle per second
| Megahertz |1 MHz = 1,000,000 Hz | One million cycles per second
| Gigahertz |1 GHz = 1000 MHz = 1000,000,000 Hz| One billion cycles per second

<br>
Multi-core processors were developed to help CPUs run faster as it became more difficult to increase clock speed. 

[^clock]: <https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/tech-takes/what-is-processor-speed>
#### Number of cores
Processor cores are individual processing units within the computer’s central processing unit (CPU). The processor core receives instructions from a single computing task, working with the clock speed to quickly process this information and temporarily store it in the Random Access Memory (RAM). Permanent information is saved to your hard drive when you request it. [^core]

With more cores, computers can process more instructions at the same time. Assessing the effect of having several cores on the processing speed is beyond the scope of this book. 

[^core]: <https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/tech-takes/what-is-processor-speed>
#### Cache size
A greater cache size implies data is retrieved faster but as we have seen previously, cache is very expensive.


## 1.3.2 Communication devices
We have seen how Computer interact with the outside world. Humans can feed data into computers using *input devices.* Computers display the results to the outside world using *output devices.* The questions that comes to the mind is, How does a computer say Desktop A communicate to another computer say Laptop B?

The illustration above shows the various components of a computer. All the components are connected via *buses* and thus, they can exchange information among each other. If you are interested to learn more about computer buses, you can do further reading [here.](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/b/bus.htm)

# 1.4 Operating System
An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer.[^os] By this definition, you must have guessed that the operating system is the most important program in your computer system. 

Example of popular operating systems include:
- Microsoft Windows
- Linux
- Android
- Apply MacOS

Some functions of the operating system include:
- Memory Management
- File Management
- Device Management
- Process Management
- Input and Output System Management
- Resource Allocation
- Security
- Networking 

You will learn more in-depth about the Operating Systems in the Introduction to Operating System Course at the University of Regina.
