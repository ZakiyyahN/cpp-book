# 1.1 Introduction to Problem Solving
To understand the concept of problem solving, let us first consider a problem.

**Problem:** Suppose John has a racing car and he wishes to improve its speed. 
In what ways can he solve this problem?

</p>

**Step 1:** Find the origin of the problem. Is the root of the problem the engine, gravity or the wind?
>Let us suppose the root of the problem was the engine.

**Step 2:** Search for possible solutions.
 1. Change the engine (Jet)    
 2. Improve the engine    
 3. Change the fuel
 
**Step 3:** Implement the top solutions.
 >John decides to go forth with: Change the engine (jet) and Change the fuel. He implements the two solutions he chose.

**Step 4:** Evaluate the implemented solutions and choose the solution which is best.
>John evaluates the implemented solutions and finds out that changing the jet is more efficient in improving the racing speed of his car.

The following picture summarizes the concept of problem solving.

***Definition**: Problem Solving is the process of understanding a given problem, exploring potential solutions, implementing top solutions and evaluating the results. In Computer Science, problem solving is the process of developing an algorithm to solve a particular problem and developing a program to implement the algorithm.*

#### Food for thought: Why is problem solving important in Computer Science?
 - Well, problem solving is the cornerstone of Computer Science. Computers have been used to solve several problems. 
 - There are still problems like Big Data for which we are still finding solutions using computers. 
 - Computers are great at doing repetitive tasks. Computers
   can simulate a model of the real world.

# 1.3 Computers
*A **computer** is a machine or device that performs processes, calculations and operations based on instructions provided by a software or hardware program. It has the ability to accept data (input), process it, and then produce outputs.*      [^computer]

[^computer]: <https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4607/computer>

The illustration below shows the different types of computers with examples.

## 1.3.1 Input and Output Devices
#### Input device

*An input device is any hardware device that sends data to a computer, allowing you to interact with and control it.* [^input]     
You can learn more about specific input devices and their uses [here](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/inputdev.htm).

#### Output device

*An **output device** is any peripheral that receives data from a computer, usually for display, projection, or physical reproduction.* [^output]

You can learn more about specific output devices and their uses [here](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/o/outputde.htm).
