## 5.1 Enumerated Types

An enumerated type:
- is a user-defined data type
- consists of enumerators (named constants)
- constants are of integral type.

**Syntax:**

enum Identifier {VALUE1, VALUE2, …, VALUEN}

**Example:**

enum Drink {COFFEE, MOCHA, MILKSHAKE, TEA, ICEDCOFFEE}

**Explanation:**

- The **enum** keyword is used to declared an enumerated type.
- The **identifier** is the name of the enum type.
- The **enum list** consists of named constants. 
- By default, the constants in the enum list take the following values:
0 for the first constant, 1 for the second constant and so on.
- From the example above: the constants in the enum list has the following values:

- The default value can be changed during the declaration stage.

```cpp

enum Drink
{   COFFEE = 0, 
    MOCHA = 5, 
    MILKSHAKE = 7,
    TEA = 9,
    ICEDCOFFEE = 15
};

```

**Note:** It is good practice to write the constants within the enum list in uppercase. 

#### Declaring a variable of an enumerated type
**Syntax:**

```cpp Identifier variableName; ```

**Example:**

```cpp Drink customerOrder ```


#### Assigning a value to the variable:
**Syntax:**

```cpp variableName = value; ```

**Example:**

```cpp customerOrder = COFFEE; ```

#### Declaring and initializing a variable:
**Syntax:**

```cpp Identifier variableName = value; ```

**Example:**

```cpp Drink customerOrder = COFFEE; ```

#### Declaring an enum type and declaring and initializing a variable in a single line:
**Syntax:**

```cpp 

enum Identifier {VALUE1, VALUE2 VALUE3, VALUE4,...,  VALUEN} variableName = VALUE[X]; //where X is a value from 1 to N

```

**Example:**

```cpp 

enum Drink {COFFEE, MOCHA, MILKSHAKE, TEA, ICEDCOFFEE} customerOrder = MOCHA;
```

## 5.2 String
Strings are used for storing text. A string variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes.[^string]

[^string]:<https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_strings.asp>

- As mentioned in the previous chapter, string is not a primitive type but rather it is an object type.
- To use strings, you must include an additional header file in the source code, the <string> library.[^string] The <string> library can be included using the following phrase: ```cpp #include <string> ```
>end of string is a null - more info about this with a valid source


#### Declare a string
 A string may be declared with or without an initial value. If you do not indicate the initial value, the initial value is an empty string (zero length, no characters).
**Syntax:**

```cpp string stringIdentifier; ```

**Example:**

```cpp string sentence;```

#### Initialize a string
**Syntax:**

```cpp stringIdentifier = “sequence of characters”; ```

**Example:**

```cpp sentence = “This is a string.”;```


#### Declare and Initialize a string in one line
**Syntax:**

```cpp string stringIdentifier = “sequence of characters”;```

**Example:**

```cpp string sentence = “This is a string”;```

#### Output a string

To display text on the console, ```cpp std::cout``` is used. In case the ```cpp using namespace std;``` declaration is used, ```cpp cout``` is used to display strings.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream> 
#include <string>  // required to use strings
using namespace std;

string sentence = "This is an example of a string\n";
cout << sentence; // display the text sotred in the variable sentence to the console

return 0;
```
**Output:**
>insert photo here

#### Read a string

We have learnt in chapter 2 that in order to read a value, we may use:
 - ```std::cin >> number;```
 - ```cin >> number; ``` in case you include the ```using namespace std;``` declaration.

Let us try the same method to read a string.

**Example 1:**

> Add photo here
> Add replit here
As can be seen from the above example, cin considers a space (whitespace, tabs, etc) as a terminating character, which means that it can only display a single word (even if you type many words)[^read].

[^read]:<https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_strings_input.asp>

**Example 2:**

> Add photo here
> Add replit here

To summarize, there are 2 ways to read a string.

|cin|getline()  |
|:-----:|:-----:|
|Syntax: cin >> stringIdentifier  | Syntax: getline (cin, stringIdentifier, delimiter)  |
Read every character until it encounters a whitespace. | Read every character until it encounters the delimiter. If the delimiter is not specified, it is ‘\n’ by default.|

#### Functions for strings
###### The `length()` and `size()` Functions

Both of these functions return the number of characters in the string. 
It returns a special type: size_type. It is an unsigned integer. 
We use the qualified `name string::size_type` because the definition of 
`size_type` is otherwise hidden inside the definition of the string type.

```cpp
string str8 = "Hello";
string::size_type len;

//Store returned values in a variable, then use them:
len = str8.length();
cout << len << endl; // prints 5
len = str8.size();
cout << len << endl; // also prints 5

// OR just use them directly:
cout << str8.length() << endl;
Add function for strings
```

**The `find()` and `substr()` Functions**

The `find()` function searches the string it is called on, to find the first occurrence of a particular substring.

- If the substring is found, `find()` returns the position of the first character. 
  If not, `find()` returns the special value `string::npos`.

- The `first argument` is the search substring. It is a string or string literal.
- The `second argument` is where to start searching. It is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
- If you leave it out, `find()` starts at 0.
 
 For example:

```cpp
string str16 = "abcdefghi";
string str17 = "def";

// Search from the beginning of str16
string::size_type pos = str16.find(str17);
cout << pos << endl; // prints 3

// Search from the beginning of str16
pos = str16.find(str17,0);
cout << pos << endl; // prints 3

// Search from the fifth position of str16
pos = str16.find(str17,5);
cout << pos << endl; // prints a REALLY BIG number!!
pos = str16.find("AB");

if(pos == string::npos)
{
    cout << "Not found." << endl;
    return 1;
}
```

- The `substr()` function cuts a substring out of a string. The `substr()` function always returns a substring of the string it is called on the first parameter is the start position of the substring the other parameter is is the length of the substring.
- If you leave it out, `substr()` returns everything from the start position to the end of the string.

For example:

```cpp
string str18 = "abcdefghi"
string str19 = str18.substr(5,2);
cout <<str19 <<endl; // prints "fg"
string str20 = str18.substr(5);
cout <<str20 <<endl; // prints "fghi"
```

###### String Subscript Operator
> Add contents here 

#### Operators and strings
A number of C++ operators also work with strings.

###### Assignment operator
The assignment operator = may be used in several ways:

```cpp
//Assigning one string's value to another string
string string_one = "Hello";
string string_two;
string_two = string_one;
```
```cpp
//Assigning a single character (char) to a string
string string_four;
char ch = 'A';
string_four = ch;
string_four = 'Z';
```

###### Concatenate strings using ```+`` operator
Two strings can be added together to create a new string. This is called string **concatenation.**
A white space can also be concatenated to a string by adding `" "` or  `' '` by using the `+` operator. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>;
#include <string>;
using namespace std;

string word1 = Hot;
string word2 = Chocolate;
string concat1 = string1 + string2; // resulting string = HotChocolate

string concat2 = string1 + " " + string2; // resulting string = Hot Chocolate
```

**Example:**
>picture here
**Output:**
>picture here

The "+=" operator appends implying that it combines the assignment and concatenation operations in the way
that you would expect. The right-hand sice must be a string object, a string literal, or a single character.

```cpp
string str1 = "Hello ";
str1 += "there";
```

###### Compare strings using relational operators ``` ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=  ```
Relational operators can be used to compare string literals.

**Example**[^compare]

```cpp
// string comparisons
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main ()
{
  std::string foo = "alpha";
  std::string bar = "beta";

  if (foo==bar) std::cout << "foo and bar are equal\n";
  if (foo!=bar) std::cout << "foo and bar are not equal\n";
  if (foo< bar) std::cout << "foo is less than bar\n";
  if (foo> bar) std::cout << "foo is greater than bar\n";
  if (foo<=bar) std::cout << "foo is less than or equal to bar\n";
  if (foo>=bar) std::cout << "foo is greater than or equal to bar\n";

  return 0;
}

```
