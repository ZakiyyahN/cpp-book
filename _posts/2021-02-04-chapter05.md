## 5.1 Enumerated Types

An enumerated type:
- is a user-defined data type
- consists of enumerators (named constants)
- constants are of integral type.

**Syntax:**

enum Identifier {VALUE1, VALUE2, …, VALUEN}

**Example:**

enum Drink {COFFEE, MOCHA, MILKSHAKE, TEA, ICEDCOFFEE}

**Explanation:**

- The **enum** keyword is used to declared an enumerated type.
- The **identifier** is the name of the enum type.
- The **enum list** consists of named constants. 
- By default, the constants in the enum list take the following values:
0 for the first constant, 1 for the second constant and so on.
- From the example above: the constants in the enum list has the following values:

- The default value can be changed during the declaration stage.

```cpp

enum Drink
{   COFFEE = 0, 
    MOCHA = 5, 
    MILKSHAKE = 7,
    TEA = 9,
    ICEDCOFFEE = 15
};

```

**Note:** It is good practice to write the constants within the enum list in uppercase. 

#### Declaring a variable of an enumerated type
**Syntax:**

```cpp Identifier variableName; ```

**Example:**

```cpp Drink customerOrder ```


#### Assigning a value to the variable:
**Syntax:**

```cpp variableName = value; ```

**Example:**

```cpp customerOrder = COFFEE; ```

#### Declaring and initializing a variable:
**Syntax:**

```cpp Identifier variableName = value; ```

**Example:**

```cpp Drink customerOrder = COFFEE; ```

#### Declaring an enum type and declaring and initializing a variable in a single line:
**Syntax:**

```cpp 

enum Identifier {VALUE1, VALUE2 VALUE3, VALUE4,...,  VALUEN} variableName = VALUE[X]; //where X is a value from 1 to N

```

**Example:**

```cpp 

enum Drink {COFFEE, MOCHA, MILKSHAKE, TEA, ICEDCOFFEE} customerOrder = MOCHA;
```

## 5.2 String
Strings are used for storing text. A string variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes.[^string]

[^string]:<https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_strings.asp>

- As mentioned in the previous chapter, string is not a primitive type but rather it is an object type.
- To use strings, you must include an additional header file in the source code, the <string> library.[^string] The <string> library can be included using the following phrase: ```cpp #include <string> ```
>end of string is a null - more info about this with a valid source


#### Declare a string
**Syntax:**

```cpp string stringIdentifier; ```

**Example:**

```cpp string sentence;```

#### Initialize a string
**Syntax:**

```cpp stringIdentifier = “sequence of characters”; ```

**Example:**

```cpp sentence = “This is a string.”;```


#### Declare and Initialize a string in one line
**Syntax:**

```cpp string stringIdentifier = “sequence of characters”;```

**Example:**

```cpp string sentence = “This is a string”;```

#### Output a string

To display text on the console, ```cpp std::cout``` is used. In case the ```cpp using namespace std;``` declaration is used, ```cpp cout``` is used to display strings.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream> 
#include <string>  // required to use strings
using namespace std;

string sentence = "This is an example of a string\n";
cout << sentence; // display the text sotred in the variable sentence to the console

return 0;
```
**Output:**

#### Read a string

We have learnt in chapter 2 that in order to read a value, we may use:
 - ```std::cin >> number;```
 - ```cin >> number; ``` in case you include the ```using namespace std;``` declaration.

Let us try the same method to read a string.
#### Functions for strings

#### String Subscript Operator

#### Concatenate strings using ```+`` operator

#### Compare strings using relational operators ``` ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=  ```
