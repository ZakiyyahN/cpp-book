## Operators
In computer science, an **operator** is a character or characters that determine the action that is to be performed or considered.[^op] An operator is used in an expression to perform operations on values or variables [^op1].

## 3.2 Arithmetic Expressions
Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations with operands. There are two types of arithmetic operators: 
- Unary operators 
    Unary operators perform an action with a single operand. 
- Binary operators. 
    Binary operators perform actions with two operands.

In a complex expression which consist of two or more operands, the order of evaluation depends on **precedence rules** and **associativity rules** (for operators with the same level of precedence).


|Operators|Number of operands |Description|
| ------------------------| :--:| --------   |
| Unary plus `+` | 1 | Maintains the values of the operand|
| Unary minus `-`| 1 | Changes the sign of the operand.  | 
| Addition `+`| 2 | Add its operands together | 
| Subtraction `-` | 2 |Subtract the value of the second operand from the first one | 
| Multiplication `*`| 2 | Computes the product of the two operand| 
|  Division `/`| 2 | Takes the first operand and divides it by the second one| 
|  Increment `++`| 2 | Increase the value of the operand by 1| 
|  Decrement `--`| 2 | Decrease the value of the operand by 1|
| Modulus `%`| 2 | Used to obtain the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second one|

### Examples of arithmetic operators
##### Unary plus `+`
```cpp
int number1= 3;
int number2 = + number1; // number2 = 3
```

#####  Unary minus `-`
```cpp
int number1= 3;
int number2 = - number1; // number2 = -3 (Positive becomes negative)
int number3 = - number2; // number3 = 3 (Negative becomes positive)
```

##### Addition `+`
```cpp
int number1 = 5;
int number2 = 3;
int sum = number1 + number2; //sum = 5 + 3 = 8
```

##### Substraction `-`
```cpp
int number1 = 5;
int number2 = 3;
int difference = number1 - number2; //difference = 5 - 3 = 2
```

##### Multiplication `*`
```cpp
int number1 = 2;
int number2 = 3;
int product = number1 * number2; // product = 2 * 3 = 6
```

##### Division `/`
```cpp
int number1 = 7;
int number2 = 2;
float result = number1/number2; // 7/2 = 3
```
From the example above, we can see that the result of dividing 7 by 2.

**Why is the answer '3' instead of '3.5' as we usually obtain when computing this division on a traditional calculator?**

</p>


- Both ‘7’ and ‘2’ are integer literals and thus, when the division operator is applied, the fraction part is truncated.
- To obtain an answer with of a floating point data type, we need to make either one (or both) operand(s) of floating point type. 
- The examples given by the cout statements are hardcoded.
- If we want to get the correct answer, we can use explicit casting. 

```cpp
int number1 = 7;
int number2 = 2;

cout << 7/2;     // 7/2 = 3
cout << 7.0/2;   // 7.0/2 = 3.5
cout << 7/2.0;   // 7/2.0 = 3.5
cout << 7.0/2.0; // 7.0/2.0 = 3.5

float result1 = (float)number1/number2; // 7.0/2 = 3.5
float result2 = number1/(float)number2; // 7/2.0 = 3.5
float result3 = (float)number1/(float)number2; // 7.0/2.0 = 3.5
```

---
Increment and decrement are both unary operators which increase and decrease the value of the associated operand by 1 respectively. 

##### Increment `++`

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/img/book/c3/inc.png" width="500" height="346" alt="Increment Operator">
</p>

```cpp
//Pre-increment
int number1 = 1;
int temp1 = ++number1 + 2; //temp1 = 2 + 2 = 4
cout << number1 << endl;   //number1 = 2 since it was incremented
cout << temp1 <<endl;      //temp1 = 4 

//Post-increment
int number2 = 1;
int temp2 = number2++ + 2; //temp2 = 1 + 2 = 3
cout << number2 << endl;   //number2 = 2 since it was incremented
cout << temp2 << endl;     //temp2 = 3
```

##### Decrement `--`

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/img/book/c3/dec.png" width="500" height="310" alt="Decrement Operator">
</p>

```cpp
//Pre-decrement
int number1 = 1;
int temp1 = --number1 + 2; //temp1 = 0 + 2 = 2
cout << number1 << endl;   //number1 = 0 since it was decremented
cout << temp1 <<endl;      //temp1 = 2 

//Post-decrement
int number2 = 1;
int temp2 = number2-- + 2; //temp2 = 1 - 2 = -1
cout << number2 << endl;   //number2 = 0 since it was incremented
cout << temp2 << endl;     //temp2 = -1
```

##### Modulo - Remainder Division `%`

```cpp
int number1 = 7;
int number2 = 2;
float result = number1 % number2; // 7 % 2 = 1
```

     We use the pow (x,y) function to carry out exponent functions. This function is defined in the cmath header file.
</details>
---

   **Syntax**
   ```cpp
    pow(x,y) = x^y
   ```
    
   **Example**
   ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    #include <cmath>  //required to use the pow() function
    using namespace std;

    int base_value = 2;
    int exponent = 3;
    double power = pow(base_value, exponent); // power = 2 ^ 3 = 8
   ```

## 3.3 Relational Operators
A relational operator is used to check the relationship between two operands.[^relation]

|Operator|Number of operands |Description  |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| `==` | 2 | Equal To |
|`!=` | 2 |Not Equal To|
| `>`| 2 |Greater than|
| `<`| 2 |Less than|
| `>=`| 2 |Greater than or Equal To|
| `<=`| 2 |Less than or Equal To|


#####  3.3.1 Equal To `==`
```cpp
int number1 = 5;
int number2 = 3;
int number3 = 5;

cout << (number1 == number2); // 5 == 3 displays 0 (false)
cout << (number1 == number2); // 5 == 5 displays 1 (true)
```

##### 3.3.2 Not Equal To `!=`
```cpp
int number1 = 5;
int number2 = 3;
int number3 = 5;

cout << (number1 != number2); // 5 != 3 displays 1 (true)
cout << (number1 != number2); // 5 != 5 displays 0 (false)
```

##### 3.3.3 Greater than `>`
```cpp
int number1 = 5;
int number2 = 3;
int number3 = 5;

cout << (number1 > number2); // 5 > 3 displays 1 (true)
cout << (number2 > number1); // 3 > 5 displays 0 (false)
cout << (number1 > number2); // 5 > 5 displays 0 (false)

```

##### 3.3.4 Less Than `<`
```cpp
int number1 = 5;
int number2 = 3;
int number3 = 5;

cout << (number1 < number2); // 5 < 3 displays 0 (false)
cout << (number2 < number1); // 3 < 5 displays 1 (true)
cout << (number1 < number2); // 5 < 5 displays 0 (false)
```

##### 3.3.5 Greater than or Equal To `>=`
```cpp
int number1 = 5;
int number2 = 3;
int number3 = 5;

cout << (number1 >= number2); // 5 >= 3 displays 1 (true)
cout << (number2 >= number1); // 3 >= 5 displays 0 (false)
cout << (number1 >= number2); // 5 >= 5 displays 1 (true)

```

##### 3.3.6 Less Than or Equal To `<=`
```cpp
int number1 = 5;
int number2 = 3;
int number3 = 5;

cout << (number1 <= number2); // 5 <= 3 displays 0 (false)
cout << (number2 <= number1); // 3 <= 5 displays 1 (true)
cout << (number1 <= number2); // 5 <= 5 displays 1 (true)
```

## 3.4 Assignment Operators

|Operator| Number of operands| Description  |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| `=` | 2 | Simple assignment - Assigns the value of the second operand to the first operand |
|`+=` | 2 |Addition Assignment - Assigns the sum of the first and second operands to the first operand|
| `-=`| 2 |Subtraction Assignment - Assigns the difference of the first and second operands to the first operand|
| `*=`| 2 |Multiplication assignment - Assigns the product of the first and second operands to the first operand|
| `/=`| 2 |Division assignment - Assigns the value when the first operand is divided by the second one to the first operand|
| `%=`| 2 |Modulo assignment - Assigns the sum of the first and second operands to the first operand|

##### Simple Assignment `=`
```cpp
int number1 = 10;
int number2 = 2;

int number1 = number2 // number1 = number2 therefore,  number1 = 2 
```
##### Addition Assignment `+=`
```cpp
int number1 = 10;
int number2 = 2;

int number1 += number2 // number1 = number1 + number2 = 10 + 2 = 12 
```
##### Subtraction Assignment `-=`
```cpp
int number1 = 10;
int number2 = 2;

int number1 -= number2 // number1 = number1 - number2 = 10 - 2 = 8 
```

##### Multiplication Assignment `*=`
```cpp
int number1 = 10;
int number2 = 2;

int number1 *= number2 // number1 = number1 * number2 = 10 * 2 = 20 
```

##### Division Assignment `/=`
```cpp
int number1 = 10;
int number2 = 2;

int number1 /= number2 // number1 = number1 / number2 = 10 / 2 = 5 
```

##### Addition Assignment `+=`
```cpp
int number1 = 10;
int number2 = 2;

int number1 %= number2 // number1 = number1 % number2 = 10 % 2 = 0 
```

## Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to determine the logic betweeen the operands. [^logical] The result of using a logical operator is of boolean type. 

In C++, data type *bool* is used to represent *Boolean data*. A Boolean expression asserts 
(states) that something is `true` or `false`. It is named after the mathematician George Boole.
Each *bool* constant or variable contains one of these two possible values: `true` or `false`. 
- `true` has the value `1` and 
- `false` has the value `0`.

If a testing expression is not of *bool* type, it is coerced to *bool* type automatically when 
it is evaluated. 
- A *non-zero* value is coerced to `true`, and 
- a *zero* value is coerced to `false`.


|Operator| Number of operands| Description  |
|:--:|:----:|:--:|
| AND `&&` | 2 | The result yields `true` if both operands are `true`|
|OR `||`  | 2 |The result yields `true` if either one operand or both of them are `true`|
| NOT `!`| 1 |The operand inverts the value of its operand|
|XOR `^`| 2 | The result yields `true` only if both operands have different values - one operand is true and the other one is false|

##### Logical AND `&&`
```cpp
bool a = 0;
bool b = 1;

bool result1 = (a && a); //result1 = 0 AND 0 = 0
bool result2 = (a && b); //result2 = 0 AND 1 = 0
bool result3 = (b && a); //result3 = 1 AND 0 = 0
bool result4 = (b && b); //result4 = 1 AND 1 = 1
```
##### Logical OR `||`
```cpp
bool a = 0;
bool b = 1;

bool result1 = (a || a); //result1 = 0 OR 0 = 0
bool result2 = (a || b); //result2 = 0 OR 1 = 1
bool result3 = (b || a); //result3 = 1 OR 0 = 1
bool result4 = (b || b); //result4 = 1 OR 1 = 1
```
##### Logical NOT `!`
```cpp
bool a = 0;
bool b = 1;

bool result1 = !a; //result1 = !0 = 1
bool result2 = !b; //result2 = !1 = 0
```
##### Logical XOR `^`
```cpp
bool a = 0;
bool b = 1;

bool result1 = (a ^ a); //result1 = 0 XOR 0 = 0
bool result2 = (a ^ b); //result2 = 0 XOR 1 = 1
bool result3 = (b ^ a); //result3 = 1 XOR 0 = 1
bool result4 = (b ^ b); //result4 = 1 XOR 1 = 0
```

#### Logical Operators and Short Circuit
Now that we have an idea about logical operators, let us have a look at the concept of **short circuit**. 
Before doing so, let us review the results of the different operators in a table. 

It is a good time to introduce the concept of **logic gates**. You will learn more about logic gates in advanced Computer courses. A logic gate is a device that acts as a building block for digital circuits. They perform basic logical functions that are fundamental to digital circuits. Most electronic devices we use today will have some form of logic gates in them.[^logic]

##### AND
| Operand 1: A | Operand 2: B | Result |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

**What pattern do you notice?**
The result is:
- 0 (FALSE) if either A or B is 0 and  
- 1 (TRUE) only if both A and B is 1.

Let us consider the following expression:
( (**expression1**) && (*expression2*) )

Based on the table above, short circuit is applicable in the following ways:

- If **expression1** is false:
   - the combined result is false
   - *expression2* is not evaluated
- *expression2* is evaluated only if **expression1** is true

##### OR

| Operand 1: A | Operand 2: B | Result |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

**What pattern do you notice?**

The result is:
- 0 (FALSE) only if both A and B is 0 and  
- 1 (TRUE) only if either A or B is 1.

Let us consider the following expression:
( (**expression1**) || (*expression2*) )

Based on the table above, short circuit is applicable in the following ways:
- If **expression1** is true:
   - the combined result is true
   - *expression2* is not evaluated.
- *expression2* is only evaluated if expression1 is false.

###### Operator Short-circuit:

| `&&` | if the left-hand side expression is `false`, the combined result is `false`. (the right-hand side expression is never evaluated)|
|:----:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `or` | if the left-hand side expression is `true`, the combined result is `true`. (the right-hand side expression is never evaluated)  |


This is mostly important when the right-hand expression has side effects, 
such as altering values:

```cpp
if( (i<10) && (++i<n) ) { /*...*/ } // note that the condition increments i   
```

Here, the combined conditional expression would increase `i` by one, but
only if the condition on the left of `&&` is `true`, because otherwise,
the condition on the right-hand side (`++i<n`) is never evaluated.




## 3.10 Conditional Ternary Operators

*The conditional operator* evaluates an expression, returning one value if
that expression evaluates to `true`, and a different one if the expression
evaluates as `false`. Its syntax is:

```cpp
condition ? result1 : result2
```

If condition is `true`, the entire expression evaluates to `result1`, and otherwise to `result2`.

```cpp
7==5 ? 4 : 3     // evaluates to 3, since 7 is not equal to 5.
7==5+2 ? 4 : 3   // evaluates to 4, since 7 is equal to 5+2.
5>3 ? a : b      // evaluates to the value of a, since 5 is greater than 3.
a>b ? a : b      // evaluates to whichever is greater, a or b.  
```

###### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a, b, c;
    a=2;
    b=7;
    c = (a>b) ? a : b;
    cout << "c is " << c << endl;
}
```

###### Output:

```text
c is 7
```

###### Try it yourself:

  height="400px"

  sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals">
</iframe>


In this example, `a` is 2, and `b` is 7, so the expression which is evaluated
(`a>b`) is not `true`, thus the first value specified after the question
mark was discarded in favor of the second value (the one after the
colon) which was `b` (with a value of `7`).


## 3.11 Operator Precedence and Associativity

If *relational operators* and *Boolean operators*
are combined in the same expression in C++, the Boolean operator `NOT (!)`
has the highest precedence, the relational operators have the next
highest precedence, and the Boolean operators `AND (&&)` and `OR (||)`
have the lowest. Expressions in parentheses are always evaluated first.

A single expression may have multiple operators. For example:

```cpp
x = 5 + 7 % 2;
```

In C++, the above expression always assigns 6 to variable x, because
the `%` operator has a higher precedence than the `+` operator and is always
evaluated before. Parts of the expressions can be enclosed in parentheses to override this precedence order, or to make explicitly
clear the intended effect. Notice the difference:

```cpp
x = 5 + (7 % 2); // x = 6 (same as without parenthesis)
x = (5 + 7) % 2; // x = 0
```

From greatest to smallest priority, C++ operators are evaluated in the order of precedence
(Chapter 2)

## 3.12 Debugging- Finding and Fixing Errors

As discussed before in section 3.6, compiler shows where the syntax errors 
came from and why they are wrong. They are also easy to find and correct. Runtime errors, on the other hand, are not
difficult to find either. They can be due to the wrong algorithm, misspelled keywords or syntax
usage. In this case, we can follow the address of the error which is shown in the console and try to fix them.


![compilation error](../assets/img/book/c3/error0.png)

> The console message shows that the error is located in line 7 and the 5th character.

On the other hand, Some sorts of errors is not that much obvious.
The program may compile successfully, however; the output is not the expected one.
When we lead to this situation, it means there is a problem with our code. These logic errors are called *bugs*, and 
the process of finding and correcting these errors is *debugging*. One of the most common approach to debugging is to 
easily follow the flow of the program and hand trace it, so you can step through instruction, track the values of 
variables, and finally find and correct the errors. However, regarding the 
complex program with a variety of the variables and statements, it cannot be that easy and fast to be done manually.


Followings are some technics and tools work as debuggers:


#### Print Out Step by Step!

- In each line of a code, you should know the value of each variable; if you are not sure about them, print them out.
  > For more readability, you can print the value of a variable *before* and *after* a statement. 
  > So, you can see how the statement changes its value.

- Detecting whether a particular scope of a code is being executed or not, you can easily print out a message in that
considered part of the code.
  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  
  using namespace std;
  
  int main()
  {
      int a;
      cin>>a;
      if ( (a*24/14)%2 > 3 ) 
      {
          // This message never appear as long as the condition of the if statement will never occur. 
          cout << "got here!" << endl; 
          a *= 2;
      }
      cout << a << endl;
      return 0;
  }
  ```


#### Setting Breakpoint

When you know where your programming error starts, a breakpoint on that line can be set out and have the program executed.
We can set as many as breakpoints we want, at a specific statement, such as `break` and `continue` to skip the rest of 
the program.


#### Run the Program After Each Change

This is not a technique for debugging, but a method to make sure you don't miss any bugs in your code.
To show the effect of changes in each statement in your program,you can run one statement in the program at a time.



#### Use IDE's Debugger

Usually IDEs have some sorts of tools for debugging which allows to check the values of the variables and show  
the execution of the program, line by line. These utilities also let you set breakpoints through the program, modify 
variables, run different sections of a code separately,etc.

## 3.13 Exercises

### Barnie and The State of the Slushy

After a lot of hard work, Barnie got the offer. McDook's seller let Barnie make slushy by herself.
The machine that makes slushy have a small monitor that displays only one number.
Barnie does not know the meaning of the number, so she asks you to write a program for her.

The number that display in the monitor is the temperature of the slushy.
We know that if the temperature is under `0`, it's `ICE` and if it's above the `100`, it's `STEAM`.
Everything else between `0` and `1000` is `LIQUID`.

Your program should get the number of the temperature and in the next line print out the state of the slushy.

### Barnie and the Cameras

McDook's building is monitored by 4 CCTV cameras. 
Barnie wants to leave the building, but she doesn't want to be recorded by cameras.
She knows that the cameras are at the 4 vertices of a rectangle.
She can see 3 of them, and she wants to know the 4th one's coordinate.

In the first 3 lines, two number gives to you the x and the y of a corner of rectangle.
You should display the x and y of the 4th corner in the next line.

Sample Input:

```text
1 2
3 4
1 4
```

Sample Output:

```text
3 2
```

## 3.14 Chapter Summary

In this chapter, we learned how to use `if-else` and `switch` statements. 
We also learned how to write an expression for an `if-else` statement using 
operators and Boolean variables. Moreover, we know there are some common 
errors that we could check whenever our program has some problems with
running properly.
