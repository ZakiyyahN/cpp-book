## 3.1 Introduction and Objectives

In the previous chapters we learned about **programming fundamentals**. 
In this chpater we will learn how to use conditional instructions to 
do some particular tasks when the input satisfies some conditions provided. 


## 3.2 The bool Data Type

In C++, data type **bool** is used to represent Boolean data.
Each **bool** constant or variable contains one of two values: **true** or **false**. 
**true** and **false** are two C++ constants. **true** has the value `1`. **false** has the value `0`.

-   If a testing expression is not of **bool** type, it is coerced to **bool** type automatically when it is evaluated.
-   A nonzero value is coerced to **true** and a zero value is coerced to **false**.


## 3.3 if Statements

If statement allows the programmer to change the logical order of a
program; that is, make the order in which the statements are executed
differ from the order in which they are listed in the program.



### 3.3.1 If-Then Statement

The **If-Then** statement uses a Boolean expression to determine whether to
execute a statement or to skip it. Here is the syntax template:

```cpp
if(Expression)
{
    Statement
}
```

The expression in parentheses can be of any simple data type.
Almost without exception, this will be a logical (Boolean) expression; 
if not, its value is implicitly coerced to type `bool`.

> non-zero value means true, zero value means false.


Now let's look at the following code:

```cpp
int number, sum;
sum = 10;
cout << "Please enter an integer value: " << endl;
cin >> number;
if( number < 0 )
{
    number = 0;
}
sum = sum + number;
cout << "The sum is " << sum << endl;
```

The expression (`number < 0`) is evaluated. 
If the result is **true**, the statement `number = 0;` is executed. 
If the result is **false**, the statement is skipped.
In either case, the next statement to be executed is `sum = sum + number;`.


### 3.3.2 If-Then-Else Statement

**If-Then-Else** statement uses a Boolean expression to determine which one of the two statements to execute. 
Here is the syntax template:

```cpp
if(Expression)
{
    Statement A
}
else
{
    Statement B
}
```

The expression in parentheses will be evaluated with the result of **true** or **false**. 
Here is an example:

```cpp
cout << "You are ";
if(age >= 65)
{
    cout << "a senior ";
}
else
{
    cout << "not a senior ";
}
cout << "citizen." << endl;
```

The characters `"You are "` are sent to the output stream. 
The expression `age >= 65` is evaluated. 
If the result is `true`, the characters `"a senior "` are sent to the output stream. 
If the result is `false`, the characters `"not a senior "` is sent to the output stream.
In either case, the next statement to be executed sends the the characters `"citizen."` to the output stream.

**There is one thing to point out here:**
<br>
any statement in an `IF` or `ELSE` statement could be a block or a compound statement. 
If so, they must be enclosed in a **pair of curly braces** (`{ }`). 
Here is an example which also shows a compound expression:

```cpp
if(age > 65 && gender == 'f')
{
    cout << "Quilting group meets:"; 
    cout << "Thursday afternoons at 4:00 p.m.";
}
```

<details>
<summary>
	<b>Should curly braces appear on their own line?</b>
</summary>
If you have only one line of statement, you are able to take the braces off. But this method is **not recommanded** at all.

## 3.4 Two-Way if-else Statements

If you want to perform an action if a specific condition happens you could use one-way if statement. 
For example, if you want to increment a counter when number `x` is an *even* number 
and do nothing when `x` is an *odd* number you could **use one-way if statement**:

```cpp
if( x % 2 == 0 )
{
    counter++;
}
```

However, if you want to increment the counter when the number is *even* and 
decrement it when it is *odd*, you need to **use two-way if-else statement**:

```cpp
if( x % 2 == 0 )
{
    counter++;
}
else
{
    counter--;
}
```

## 3.5 Nested if and Multi-Way if-else Statements

An **If-Then** statemeent uses Boolean expression to determine whether to
execute or skip a statemenet. An **If-Then-Else** statement uses a Boolean
expression to determine which one of the two statements to execute. The
statements to be executed or skipped could be simple statements or
compound statements (blocks). They also can be an If Statement. An If
statement within another If statement is called a **nested If** statement.

>A look-ahead: You will soon be learning about the C++ **SWITCH** statement.
For very complex if/else constructs, it is preferable to use the switch
instead.

The following example is a nested If statement.

```cpp
cout << "You are ";
if(age >= 65)
    cout << "a senior." << endl;
else
    if(age >= 19)
        cout << "an adult." << endl;
    else
        if (age >= 13)
            cout << "a teenager." << endl;
        else
            cout << "a child." << endl;
cout << "You are a great person." << endl;
```

The characters `"You are "` are sent to the output stream. The
expression `age >= 65` is evaluated. If the result is `true`, the
characters `"a senior."` are sent to the output stream. If the result
is `false`, the expression `age >= 19` is evaluated. If the result
is `true`, the characters `"an adult."` are sent to the output stream. If
the result is `false`, the expression `age >= 13` is evaluated. If the
result is `true`,the characters `"a teenager."` are sent to the output
stream. If the result is `false`, the expression `"a child."` is sent to the
output stream. In any case above, the next statement to be executed
sends the the characters `"You are a great person."` to the output
stream.

> **NOTE:** Once age has a value, only one statement is selected to be
executed. If we add braces to the program segment, it would be easy to
read. 
Let's look at it now:

```cpp
cout << "You are ";
if (age >= 65)
{
    cout << "a senior." << endl;
    cout << "*****" << endl;
}
else
{
    if(age >= 19)
    {
        cout << "an adult." << endl;
        cout << "*****" << endl;
    }
    else
    {
        if (age >= 13)
        {
            cout << "a teenager." << endl;
            cout << "*****" << endl;
        }
        else
        {
            cout << "a child." << endl;
            cout << "*****" << endl;
        }
    }
}
cout << "You are a great person." << endl;
```

Another example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    char grade;
    cout << "Please enter a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F): " << endl;
    cin >> grade;
    if(grade == 'A')
        cout << "Great work. " << endl;
    else if(grade == 'B')
        cout << "Good work. " << endl;
    else if(grade == 'C')
        cout << "Passing work. " << endl;
    else if(grade == 'D' || grade == 'F')
    {
        cout << "Unsatisfictory work. " << endl;
        cout << "See your instructor." << endl;
    }
    else
        cout << grade << " is not a legal grade." << endl;
    
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## 3.6 Common Errors and Pitfalls

The most common errors beginners make in this chapter are the syntax
errors. First check the syntax errors if you get any error such as
spellings of the identifiers 
(it should be `if` and `else` instead IF, If, Else, ELSE).

The other most common error to check for is the usage of semicolon after
the if statement, below example will explain you the usage.

```cpp
// there should not be semmicolon after an if statement
if(x>5);
    cout << "x is greater than 5";
else
    cout << "x is less than 5";
```
It is absolutely fine not to use braces after the if and else statement
if there is **only one statement** inside the block. But here the error is
we should not use the semicolon after if statement which will end the
execution at that line and you will get "**unexpected else statement found**" error. 
So, use of semicolon after the **if** or **else** or **if else** statement is not preferred
if you want to continue the execution inside the block or after the block.

## 3.7 Generating Random Numbers

Rand function:

```cpp 
int rand (void);
```

**Generate random number**

Returns a pseudo-random integral number in the range
between 0 and [RAND_MAX](http://www.cplusplus.com/RAND_MAX).

This number is generated by an algorithm that returns a sequence of
apparently non-related numbers each time it is called. This algorithm
uses a seed to generate the series, which should be initialized to some
distinctive value using
function [srand](http://www.cplusplus.com/srand).

[RAND_MAX](http://www.cplusplus.com/RAND_MAX) is a constant defined
in [\<cstdlib>](http://www.cplusplus.com/cstdlib).

A typical way to generate trivial pseudo-random numbers in a determined
range using rand is to use the **modulo** of the returned value by the range
span and add the initial value of the range:

```cpp
v1 = rand() % 100; // v1 in the range 0 to 99        
v2 = rand() % 100 + 1; // v2 in the range 1 to 100    
v3 = rand() % 30 + 1985; // v3 in the range 1985-2014
```

Notice though that this modulo operation does not generate uniformly
distributed random numbers in the span (since in most cases this
operation makes lower numbers slightly more likely).

C++ supports a wide range of powerful tools to generate random and
pseudo-random numbers
(see [\<random>](http://www.cplusplus.com/random) for more info).

An integer value between 0
and [RAND_MAX](http://www.cplusplus.com/RAND_MAX).

Example:

```cpp
//  rand example: guess the number

#include <stdlib.h>

// srand, rand

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int iSecret, iGuess;

    //  initialize random seed:                           
    // generate secret number between 1 and 10:

    iSecret = rand() % 10 + 1;                                 
    
    do
    {
        cout << "Guess the number(1 to 10): ";
        cin >> "%d", &iGuess;
        
        if(iSecret<iGuess)
            cout << "The secret number is lower" << endl;
        else if(iSecret>iGuess)
            cout << "The secret number is higher" << endl;
    } while(iSecret!=iGuess);

    cout << "Congratulations!";
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the random seed is initialized to a value representing
the current time (calling [time](http://www.cplusplus.com/time)) to
generate a different value every time the program is run.

Possible output:

```text
Guess the number (1 to 10): 5 
The secret number is higher   
Guess the number (1 to 10): 8 
The secret number is lower    
Guess the number (1 to 10): 7 
Congratulations!             
```
## 3.8 Logical Operators

The operator `!` is the C++ operator for the
Boolean operation `NOT`. It has only one operand, to its right, and
inverts it, producing false if its operand is true, and true if its
operand is false. Basically, it returns the opposite Boolean value of
evaluating its operand. For example:

| Syntax         |  Description
|------------    |----------------
| `!(5 == 5)`    | evaluates to false because the expression at its right `(5 == 5)` is true
| `!(6 <= 4)`    | evaluates to true because `(6 <= 4)` would be false
| `!true`        | evaluates to false
| `!false`       | evaluates to true 
                                 

The logical operators `&&` are used when evaluating two
expressions to obtain a single relational result. The
operator `&&` corresponds to the Boolean logical operation **AND**, which
yields **true** if **both its operands are true**, and **false** otherwise. The
following panel shows the result of operator `&&` evaluating the
expression `a&&b`:

 <dl><style type="text/css">
	table.tableizer-table {
		font-size: 12px;
		border: 1px solid #CCC; 
		font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
	} 
	.tableizer-table td {
		padding: 4px;
		margin: 3px;
		border: 1px solid #CCC;
	}
	.tableizer-table th {
		background-color: #104E8B; 
		color: #FFF;
		font-weight: bold;
	}
</style>
<table class="tableizer-table">
<thead><tr class="tableizer-firstrow"><th>&& OPERATOR (and)</th></tr></thead><tbody>
 <tr><td>a</td><td>b</td><td>a && b</td></tr>
 <tr><td>true</td><td>true</td><td>true</td></tr>
 <tr><td>true</td><td>false</td><td>false</td></tr>
 <tr><td>false</td><td>true</td><td>false</td></tr>
 <tr><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</dl>

The operator `||` corresponds to the Boolean logical operation **OR**, which
yields **true** if **either of its operands is true**, thus being **false** only
when **both operands are false**. Here are the possible results of `a||b`:

<dl><style type="text/css">
	table.tableizer-table {
		font-size: 12px;
		border: 1px solid #CCC; 
		font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
	} 
	.tableizer-table td {
		padding: 4px;
		margin: 3px;
		border: 1px solid #CCC;
	}
	.tableizer-table th {
		background-color: #104E8B; 
		color: #FFF;
		font-weight: bold;
	}
</style>
<table class="tableizer-table">
<thead><tr class="tableizer-firstrow"><th>   || OPERATOR (or)</th></tr></thead><tbody>
 <tr><td>a</td><td>b</td><td>a || b</td></tr>
 <tr><td>true</td><td>true</td><td>true</td></tr>
 <tr><td>true</td><td>false</td><td>true</td></tr>
 <tr><td>false</td><td>true</td><td>true</td></tr>
 <tr><td>false</td><td>false</td><td>false</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</dl>

For example:

```cpp
( (5 == 5) && (3 > 6) ) // evaluates to false ( true && false )       
                                                                       
( (5 == 5) || (3 > 6) ) // evaluates to true ( true || false )    
```

When using the logical operators, C++ only evaluates what is necessary
from left to right to come up with the combined relational result,
ignoring the rest. Therefore, in the last example `((5==5)||(3>6))`,
C++ evaluates first whether `5==5` is `true`, and if so, it never checks
whether `3>6` is `true` or not. This is known as 
*short-circuit evaluation*, 
and works like this for these operators:

<dl>
<style type="text/css">
	table.tableizer-table {
		font-size: 12px;
		border: 1px solid #CCC; 
		font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
	} 
	.tableizer-table td {
		padding: 4px;
		margin: 3px;
		border: 1px solid #CCC;
	}
	.tableizer-table th {
		background-color: #104E8B; 
		color: #FFF;
		font-weight: bold;
	}
</style>
<table class="tableizer-table">
<thead><tr class="tableizer-firstrow"><th>operator</th><th>short-circuit</th></tr></thead><tbody>
 <tr><td>&&</td><td>if the left-hand side expression is false, the combined result is false (the right-hand side expression is never evaluated).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>||</td><td>if the left-hand side expression is true, the combined result is true (the right-hand side expression is never evaluated).</td></tr>
</tbody></table> </dl>

This is mostly important when the right-hand expression has side
effects, such as altering values:

```cpp
if( (i<10) && (++i<n) ) { /*...*/ } // note that the condition increments i   
```

Here, the combined conditional expression would increase i by one, but
only if the condition on the left of && is true, because otherwise,
the condition on the right-hand side (`++i<n`) is never evaluated.


## 3.9 switch Statements

`switch` statement is a selection statement that can be used instead
of a series of If-Then-Else statements. `switch` statements are much
better for complex expressions. Alternative statements are listed with
a `switch` label in front of each. A `switch` label is either a case label
or the word `default`. 

A case label is the word case followed by a
constant expression. An integral expression is called a switch
expression is used to match one of the values on the case labels. The
statement associated with the value that is matched is the statement
that is executed. Execution then continues sequentially from the matched
label untill the end of the `switch` statement is encountered or
a break statement is encountered. Basically, transfers control to one of the several statements, depending
on the value of a condition.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
switch(expression)
{
  case a:
    // code block
    break;
  case b:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}
```

The body of a `switch` statement may have an arbitrary number
of case: labels, as long as the values of all *constant_expressions* are
unique (after conversions/promotions). At most one `default:` label may be
present (although nested switch statements may use their
own `default:` labels or have `case:` labels whose constants are identical
to the ones used in the enclosing `switch`)

If *condition* evaluates to the value that is equal to the value of one
of *constant_expression*s, then control is transferred to the statement
that is labeled with that *constant_expression*.

If *condition* evaluates to the value that doesn't match any of
the case: labels, and the default: label is present, control is
transferred to the statement labeled with the default: label.

The [break](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/break) statement,
when encountered in *statement* exits the switch statement:

```cpp
switch(1) 
{
    case 1 : cout << '1'; // prints "1",
    case 2 : cout << '2'; // then prints "2"
}

switch(1) 
{
    case 1 : cout << '1'; // prints "1"
    break; // and exits the switch
    case 2 : cout << '2';
    break;
}
```

Compilers may issue warnings on fall through (reaching the next case label without a break) unless the attribute appears immediately before the case label to indicate that the fall through is intentional.

Example of several usage cases of `switch` statement:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int i = 2;
    switch(i) 
    {
        case 1: 
            std::cout << "1";
        case 2: 
            std::cout << "2"; //execution starts at this case label
        case 3: 
            std::cout << "3";
        case 4:
        case 5: 
            std::cout << "45";
            break; //execution of subsequent statements is terminate
        case 6: 
            std::cout << "6";
    }

    std::cout << '\n';

    switch(i)
    {
        case 4: 
            std::cout << "a";
        default: 
            std::cout << "d"; //there are no applicable constant_expressions
        //therefore default is executed
    }

    std::cout << '\n';
 
    switch(i)
    {
        case 4:  
            std::cout << "a"; //nothing is executed
    }

    // when enumerations are used in a switch statement, many compilers
    // issue warnings if one of the enumerators is not handled
    enum color {RED, GREEN, BLUE};

    switch(RED)
    {
        case RED: 
            std::cout << "red\n";
            break;
        case GREEN: 
            std::cout << "green\n";
            break;
        case BLUE: 
            std::cout << "blue\n"; 
            break;
    }

}
```

Output:
```cpp
2345
d
red
```

## 3.10 Conditional Operators

The conditional operator evaluates an expression, returning one value if
that expression evaluates to `true`, and a different one if the expression
evaluates as `false`. Its syntax is:

```cpp
condition ? result1 : result2
```

If condition is `true`, the entire expression evaluates to `result1`, and otherwise to `result2`.

```cpp
7==5 ? 4 : 3     // evaluates to 3, since 7 is not equal to 5.
7==5+2 ? 4 : 3   // evaluates to 4, since 7 is equal to 5+2.
5>3 ? a : b      // evaluates to the value of a, since 5 is greater than 3.
a>b ? a : b      // evaluates to whichever is greater, a or b.  
```
For example:

```cpp
// conditional operator

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a, b, c;
    a=2;
    b=7;
    c = (a>b) ? a : b;
    cout <<c<<'\n';
}
```

Output:

```cpp
7
```

Try it yourself:
<iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@Baranerf/Ch33?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>

In this example, `a` was 2, and `b` was 7, so the expression being evaluated
(`a>b`) was not true, thus the first value specified after the question
mark was discarded in favor of the second value (the one after the
colon) which was `b` (with a value of `7`).

## 3.11 Operator Precedence and Associativity

If relational operators and Boolean operators
are combined in the same expression in C++, the Boolean operator `NOT (!)`
has the **highest precedence**, the relational operators have the next
highest precedence, and the Boolean operators `AND (&&)` and `OR (||)`
have the **lowest**. Expressions in parentheses are always evaluated first.

A single expression may have multiple operators. For example:
```cpp
x = 5 + 7 % 2;
```
In C++, the above expression always assigns 6 to variable x, because
the `%` operator has a higher precedence than the `+` operator and is always
evaluated before. Parts of the expressions can be enclosed in
parenthesis to override this precedence order, or to make explicitly
clear the intended effect. Notice the difference:

```cpp
x = 5 + (7 % 2); // x = 6 (same as without parenthesis)
x = (5 + 7) % 2; // x = 0

From greatest to smallest priority, C++ operators are evaluated in the order of precedence (we have seen in the previous chapter)

## 3.12 Debugging

We have discussed the common errors in the previous parts. To debug a code
you need to know the error first. Execute the code then you will see the
corresponding error, if the error you see is syntax error go to the
error line and check for the misspelled keywords and syntax usage.

If you see there is no error and the output displayed is not the desired
one then there might be a problem with defining the conditions or the
flow is not continued further due to use of semicolons or other
statements like break, continue. So, to check that you can go into debug
mode and check each step in the flow to see where we are doing wrong.

## 3.13 Chapter Summary

In this chapter, we learned how to use if-else and switch statemenets. We leanred how to write an expression for an if-else statement using operators and Boolean variables. Also, we know there are some common errors that we could check whenever our program has some problems running properly.
