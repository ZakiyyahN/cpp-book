## 2.1 Introduction and Objectives

You are about to begin an exciting journey of programming. At the outset, it is helpful to 
start with some basic concepts and fundamentals of programming.
We will learn about simple inputs/outputs, identifiers, variables, 
and related expressions in this chapter. These are crucial tools that will 
help the information be circulated through the user and the code. Additionally, We will 
learn:

- How to get the information from the user
- How to save that information
- How to do some calculation using that information and;
- How to let the user know about the result of the calculation



### 2.2 Writing a Simple Program

Writing a program involves designing a strategy for solving
a problem and then using programming language to implement
that strategy. [1^]

[1^]: Liang, D. Y. (2013a). *Introduction to Programming with C++* (Myprogramminglab) (3rd ed.). Pearson.

Let us begin with a simple C++ program that prompt the user to enter a number, 
then display a nicely formatted message of the entered number in the second line.

##### Algorithm

When we are talking about programming, first step is to design an algorithm that can solve our problem.
In this case, there are 4 steps:

1. Prompt user by a printed message to enter a number.

2. Declare a variable in order to store the number that user will enter.

3. Get the user's number.

4. Print out a nicely formatted message that shows the number which user gave us.

<!-- Another line should be here to clarify how we are going to explain -->

##### How should start?

The execution of all C++ programs begins with the `main` function. 
We will talk more about the *Functions* in chapter 6.
For now, you should know that every program we write, starts from the `main()` function:

```cpp
int main()
{
    // Your program starts from here!
}
```

> Regardless of where the function is located.
> The open brace (`{`) indicates the beginning of main's function definition, 
> and the closing brace (`}`) indicates its end.

> [To learn more about main function, check this out.](https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/program_structure/#:~:text=The%20function%20named%20main%20is%20a%20special%20function%20in%20all%20C++%20programs;%20it%20is%20the%20function%20called%20when%20the%20program%20is%20run.%20The%20execution%20of%20all%20C++%20programs%20begins%20with%20the%20main%20function,%20regardless%20of%20where%20the%20function%20is%20actually%20located%20within%20the%20code.)


##### Print out your first line!

Some times we need to prompt user some messages.
For instance, when we want to tell user to enter a number,
or when we want to display the result of a process or calculation.


###### What is `iostream`?

To perform standard input and output operations, 
such as writing the output to the screen; 
needs to include a section of standard C++ code, known as *header iostream*.

The syntax to include it in the code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

Lines beginning with a hash sign (`#`) are directives read and interpreted by 
what is known as the *preprocessor*. 
They are special lines interpreted before the compilation of the program itself begins.


###### Display the message!

```cpp
std::cout << "Please enter a number: ";
```

This line(statement) contains some parts as follows:

- `std::cout`
  : Identifies the standard character output device (usually, this is the computer screen).

- `<<` 
  : The insertion operator, which indicates that what follows is inserted into `std::cout`.

- `"Please enter a number: "` 
  : The sentence that we want to display in the screen.

- `;` 
  : This character marks the end of the statement, just as the period ends a sentence in English. 
  > All C++ statements must end with a semicolon character (`;`). 
  > 
  >> One of the most common syntax errors in C++ is forgetting to end a statement with a semicolon.


```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Please enter a number: ";
}
```

###### Standard Library of C++

If you have seen C++ code before, you may have seen `cout` being used without `std::`.
Both name the same object: 

one uses its unqualified name (`cout`), 
while another one qualifies it directly within the namespace std (`std::cout`).

`cout` is part of the **standard library of C++**, 
and all the elements in the standard C++ library are declared 
within what is called a **namespace**; in this case it is the **namespace std**.

In order to refer to the elements in the **std** namespace a program shall either 
qualify each and every use of elements of the library 
(as we have done by prefixing `cout` with `std::`), or introduce visibility of its components. 

The most typical way to introduce visibility of these components 
is by means of using declarations:

```cpp
using namespace std;
```

The above declaration allows all elements in the **std** namespace to be accessed in 
an unqualified manner (without the `std::` prefix).

Consequently, our code should look like:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Please enter a number: ";
}
```

> Add the line `using namespace std;` and remove `std::` from the beginning of the `cout`.


###### What is variables? How we can store a value in a variable?

Sometimes we need to store a value and use it in our calculation, etc.
In this case, you want to get a number from a user. 
You need to store it in the computer memory, and use it during the program (Display in the screen).

To store a value in computer memory, we can use variables.
Each variable needs a **Identifier** (name), and a **Data Type**.

For example:

```cpp
int number;
```

- Here `number` is the `Identifier` (name) of this variable. 
  In the rest of the program we can use it by call its name.

- In C++ programs, you need to tell computer 
  what type of value you want to store in this specific variable.
  We will go through the **Data Types** in this chapter, 
  but for know keep it in your mind that `int` is a data type to store numbers!

After prompt user to enter a number we need to declare a variable. 
So we can store the number which entered by user to the variable.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Please enter a number: ";
    int number;
}
```


###### Get the entered number of user and store it in variable

In order to get the value from user through the console, we use the statement below:

```cpp
std::cin >> number;
```

As we talked about the standard library of C++, 
as long as you are using the `std` namespace, you are able to remove the `std::`.
So it also can be:

```cpp
cin >> number;
```

- `number` is the name of the variable (`Identifier`) that we want to store the value in it.

By getting the number from the user our code leads to:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Please enter a number: ";
    int number;
    cin >> number;
}
```


###### Get the entered number of user and store it in variable

It is time to display the user's number in the screen.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Please enter a number: ";
    int number;
    cin >> number;
    cout << "You entered: " << number << endl;
}
```

- As you can see, we are able to print several variables and sentences in one line, 
  by put `<<` between them.
  
- The `std::endl` or `endl` is a function, that insert a new-line character. 
  Whenever we want to go to the next line, we can use it.
  > [To learn more about the `endl` click here.](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ostream/endl/)

###### How computer knows a program finished successfully?

The `main` function has a specific; it is the both entry point and exit point of our program.
The `main` function will return a number only when the program ends.
The number that returning by the `main` function has meaning for the operating system (OS).
Most of the time OS monitor our code and when the program ends by returning `0`,
OS can understand the program was successful.

> It's not particularly use in C++ programs.

> C++ programs by default return `0` when the program finishes successfully
> and `-1` or whatever when an error accrues during the runtime.
>> So far it is highly recommended using `return 0;` at the end of your program.

Let see the code after add the `return 0;`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Please enter a number: ";
    int number;
    cin >> number;
    cout << "You entered: " << number << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

###### Comments in C++ Programs

Sometimes we need to put a comment(note) in the code.
For Instance, imagine that you have a complex part in your program 
that people usually can't understand it.
To make it easy for others(even your future 😉) to understand the code, 
you can put a comment there and explain what you did there.

For example if we add some comments and explain our algorithm our code look like:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    // Prompt user to enter a number
    cout << "Please enter a number: ";

    // Declare an integer variable named `number`
    int number;
    
    // Get `number` from user through console
    cin >> number;

    // Display nicely formatted number in console
    cout << "You entered: " << number << endl;

    /*
        return 0 as exit success; 
        means program finished successfully
    */
    return 0;
    
}  // end of the program
```

-   By convention, every C++ program is better to have this kind of
    comment block at the program.
    > It does not mean that it is better to put comment for everything!
    > 
    > <details>
    > <summary>
    >   There are some suggestion regarding the comments.
    >   If you are interested click here.

-   Comment on just one line, or part of a line, begins with `//`.

-   Usually, a comment that carries over several lines begins with `/*`
    and ends with `*/`. Everything between this special characters commented.
    
> [Single or multi-line comments?](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_comments.asp)
> 
> It is up to you which you want to use. 
> Normally, we use `//` for short comments, and `/* */` for longer.

-   The first 19 lines of the code is _comment block_ which makes a brief 
    introduction to C++ program.

-   By convention, every C++ program is better to have this kind of 
    comment block at the beginning of the program

-   Usually, a comment that carries over several lines begins with `/*`
    and ends with `*/`

-   Comment on just one line, or part of a line, begins with `//`

-   Typically, there is an inline comment at the beginning or end of 
    the processing block, such as `//` at the end of the program.

-   The following two lines ,21 and 23, tell the compiler to add 
    **console** input and output (`iostream`) features to the program 
    and make them easier to use by adding their namespace.
    
-   Line 21 is what is known as a _preprocessor command_. The pound (`#`)
    sign followed by `include < >` begins every preprocessor command.

-   Any _built-in_ or _user-defined_ header files using in the program 
    must follow the same syntax.

> ##### NOTE:
> Built-in header files, in the program, are enclosed inside 
> the `<` and `>` marks, and created header files in `""` quotation marks.

-   `int main() { }`  is the executable part of our program. The function 
    name is  `main`, and it returns an integer type value which its 
    function, as indicated by the empty parentheses, has no parameters.

-   The parentheses `()` mark the beginning and end
    of a group (scope) of C++ statements. In this case, they enclose our 
    `main`
    function.

-   `int number;` sets `number` as a variable of input type **integer**.

-   `cout` is the command to print out text or data on the screen.
    Anything enclosed in quotation marks (string) is printed.

-   `cin` - command  receives data from the user.

-   The `<iostream>` file exists in every C++ program, and it is
    the file which allows us to use `cout` and `cin`.

-   The second `cout` line prints out `"You entered: [number]"`. 
    So, if I entered 5, the output would be: `You entered: 5`

-   This kind of way to get data into the program is called a 
    _user interactive input_, and it makes the program 
    interactive.

-   `endl` is a _manipulator_ to indicate the _end of the line_. It tells the
    cursor to stop printing on the current line, and begin on the next
    line.

-   `return 0;` - is there, since the return value in
    our main program was designated as an integer. It prevents the
    compiler from reporting a syntax error. `0` also means the program has been
    finished successfully.

-   `// end of the program` - a single line comment.

## 2.3 Reading Input from the Keyboard

_Reading input from the keyboard_ promotes the interaction between the user and the program.
In other words, it helps the program to gain the necessary information by enabling it to 
accept input from the user.<br> Imagine writing a program to calculate the area of a rectangle 
with a length of `x` and a width of `y`. The very first step to calculate this area is to
get the length and the width from the input. 

Working knowledge of C++ Basic I/O is an important first stage in learning C++.
Here is the table of C++ **basic Input/Output** (I/O) symbols we saw in the preceding 
program:


| **Symbol**     | **Name**            | **Description**
|  :--------:    |:----------:         |:----------------
| `cout`         | A special variable  | Used along with the insertion operator “<<” to write out the values of variables and expressions to the standard output device such as a screen.
| `<<`           | Insertion operator  | Takes two operands. Its left-hand operand is a stream expression, and its right-hand operand is an expression that could be as simple as a literal string. It can be used several times in a single output statement. 
| `cin`          | A special variable  | Used along with the extraction operator “>>” to input values from the standard input device, such as a keyboard, to a variable.                                                             
| `>>`           | Extraction operator | Takes two operands. Its left-hand operand is a stream expression. Its right-hand operand is a variable into which we store the input data. It can be used several times in a single input statement.               


Note that `cin` (pronounced see-in) stands for _console input_, and `cout` (pronounced see-out) stands 
for _console output_.


For instance, getting `x` (length) and `y` (width) from input, we could say:

```cpp
cin >> x;
cin >> y;
```

Also, we could get `x` and `y` in one line:

```cpp
cin >> x >> y;
```



## 2.4 Identifiers

In a program, _identifiers_ are the names given to elements such as variables and functions.
There are two main parts in a C++ program:

- Instructions to the C++ _preprocessor_ and _compiler_.
  
- Instructions that describe the processing to be done.

We must have a way of naming things preceding the instruction description to tell the compiler
about them and describe what we want to do with them. We call things (data types, data objects,
and actions) by giving them an _identifier_.


###  Identifiers Naming Rules

-   An identifier is made up of _letters_, _numbers_, and _underscore_ ( \_ ).

-   An identifier must start with a letter or an underscore; it cannot start with a digit.

-   An identifier should not be a _reserved word_.

-   An identifier can be of any length, however, your C++ compiler may impose restriction.


For instance, `length` and `_width1` are legal identifiers, while `1length` and `width-4` are
not legal.


> #### NOTE: 
> 
> *Reserved words* are certain words which have predefined meanings within the C++ language.
>    
> `int`, `namespace`, `using`, `include`, `cin`, `cout`, `and`, `return`, etc. are reserved words, for example. 
> You **cannot** use them as your user defined identifier such as variable names
> 
> [Check out here for more reserved words in C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword)


> #### NOTE:
>
> C++ is **case sensitive**. It means `length`, `Length`, and `LEngTh` are all different.


#### CamelCase:
*Camel case* is the practice of writing phrases without spaces or punctuation, 
indicating the separation of words with a single capitalized letter, and 
the first word starting with either case. It is often used as a naming convention in
which the first letter of each word is uppercase except for the first word. 
The rest of the letters are lower case.<br> <br>
For example, `payRate`, `camelCase`, and `numberOfYears` are `camelCase`.


<p style="text-align:center;">
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case">
        <img src="../assets/img/book/c2/CamelCase.png" alt="camelCase">
    </a>
    <p style="text-align:center;">
        CamelCase Is Named After the "Hump" of Its Protruding Capital Letter, 
        Similar to the Hump ommon Camels.
    </p>

> There are also other ways to write phrases such as `PascalCase`, `snake_case`, `kebab-case`.

## 2.5 Variables

_Variables_ are represented as memory locations that have a type, such as an
integer or character, and consequently, a size, which is inherited from
their type. Since variables are types, they have a set of operations
that can be used to change or manipulate them.

Each variable in your program must be declared and initialized. 
There are two ways in which it can be done:


- #### 1. Declare the Variables First 

    ```cpp
    char letter;
    int x;
    long student_id;
    float payRate;
    double pi;
    bool valid;
    ```
    
    Then initialize them as a separate statement, later in the program.
    
    ```cpp
    letter = 'A';
    x = 7;
    student_id = 200201202;
    payRate = 12.85;
    pi = 3.1415926536;
    valid = true;
    ```

- #### 2. Initialize the Variables While They Are Being Declared, in One Statement, Simultaneously.
    
    ```cpp
    char letter = 'A';
    int x = 7;
    long student_id = 200201202;
    double pi = 3.1415926536;
    float payRate = 12.85;
    bool valid = true;
    ```

    > A _variable_ can be used only **after its value is set**.


## 2.6 Assignment Statements and Assignment Expressions

An _assignment_ are used to designate a value for a variable, and it can also be used as an 
expression in C++ . When we declare a variable, we can assign a value to it by using an 
_assignment statement_. At the outset, You need to know the definition of an _arithmetic 
expression_ and the _precedence_ of the operators. [^1]

[^1]: Liang, D. Y. (2013a). Introduction to Programming with C++ (Myprogramminglab) (3rd ed.). Pearson.



_Arithmetic Expressions_ are defined as Variables and constants of integral and floating-point types can be combined
into expressions using arithmetic operators. [^2]

[^2]: [CS110 C++ *Arithmetic Expressions Lab*. (2021). Uregina.Ca.](https://www.cs.uregina.ca/Links/class-info/110/expressions/arithmetic.html)


## 2.7 Named Constants

The initialized variable can be declared as a _constant_ by adding the type qualifier `const` 
before the definition. [^3]

[^3]: [*CS Dept C++ Variables*. (2021). Uregina.] (https://www.cs.uregina.ca/Links/class-info/cplusplus/Csyntax-files/variables.html)
The general format for a `const` declaration is shown as below:

```cpp
const type variableName = [any value you like]
```

Inside a program, you will see constants written like this: 

```cpp
const float payRate = 12.85;
const double pi = 3.1415926536;
const char dollarSign = '$';
const string markdown = "MarkdownV2";
```


## 2.8 Numeric Data Types and Operations

A _data type_ is a set of values and a set of operations on these values
In the preceding program, we used the data type `int,` an identifier for 
the integer data type.

We used _data type_ `int` in four ways in the preceding program. 
`int` precedes `main,` the name of the `main` function in the program to indicate that the function returns the 
value of type `int.`In the end, an `int`, literal (zero) is returned as the result of the `main` function `main`. 
Also, in the middle of the program, a variable number is declared to have the data type `int`. 
In addition, an integer number was read from the keyboard and stored in the storage of variable 
number.


The following are some fundamental/simple data types:


 Integral Types                                             
----------------------------------------------------------------
 `short`           `int`              `long`           `char `         
 `unsigned short`  `unsigned int`       `unsigned long`  `unsigned char` 


 Floating Types                             
----------------------------------------------------------------
 `float`           `double `    `long double`      


The Arithmetic Operators                                           
-----------------------------------------------------------------

| Operator     | Description                                                                     
|:---------:   |----------------
| `+`          | **Unary plus** needs one operand.                                                   
| `-`          | **Unary minus** needs one operand.                                                  
| `+`          | **Addition** needs two operands.                                                    
| `-`          | **Subtraction** needs two operands.                                                 
| `\`          | **Multiplication** needs two operands.                                              
| `/`          | **Division** needs two operands. <br>Floating point operands &rightarrow; floating point result <br> Integer operands &rightarrow; integer quotient <br>  Mixed operands &rightarrow; floating point result                                              
| `%`          | **Modulus**  <br> Remainder from integer division <br>   Operands must be integral                                                                    
| `++`         | **Increment by one** <br> Can be prefix or postfix <br> As postfix has highest precedence                                                          
| `--`         | **Decrement by one** <br> Can be prefix or postfix <br> As postfix has highest precedence                                                          




## 2.9 Evaluating Expressions and Operator Precedence

The precedence rules of arithmetic apply to arithmetic expressions in a program. 
That is, the order of execution of an expression that contains more than one operation is determined by these rules of arithmetic. 
These rules state that parentheses have the highest precedence, multiplication, division, and 
modulus have the next highest precedence, and addition and subtraction have the lowest. 
Besides,the Postfix increment and decrement operators have the highest precedence over any of the arithmetic operators.


Look at the following example, and decide what is written by each of the output statements.

```cpp
// The program demonstrates the precedence of the operators.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main ()
{
    cout << 4 + 3 * 5 << endl;
    cout << (4 + 3) * 5 << endl;
    cout << 4 * 5 % 3 + 2 << endl;
    cout << (4 * (5 % 3) + 2) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

##### Output:

```text
19
35

10
```

## 2.10 Augmented Assignment Operators

_Assignment operators_ **modify** the value of the object.

| Operator name                    | Syntax     | Overloadable  |
| :--------------:                 |:------:    |:-------------:|
| simple assignment                | `a = b`    | Yes           |
| addition assignment              | `a += b`   | Yes           |
| subtraction assignment           | `a -= b`   | Yes           |
| multiplication assignment        | `a *= b`   | Yes           |
| division assignment              | `a /= b`   | Yes           |
| modulo assignment                | `a %= b`   | Yes           |
| bitwise AND assignment           | `a &= b`   | Yes           |   
| bitwise OR assignment            | `a \= b`   | Yes           |
| bitwise XOR assignment           | `a ^= b`   | Yes           |
| bitwise left shift assignment    | `a <<= b`  | Yes           | 
| bitwise right shift assignment   | `a >>= b`  | Yes           |

### Explanation

_copy assignment_ operator replaces the contents of the object `a` with a
copy of the contents of `b` (`b` is not modified). For class types, this is
a special member function, described in copy assignment operator.

_move assignment_ operator replaces the contents of the object `a` with the
contents of `b`, avoiding copying if possible (b may be modified). For
class types, this is a special member function, described in move
assignment operator. (since C++11)

For non-class types, copy and move assignment are indistinguishable and
are referred to as _direct assignment_

_compound assignment_ operators replace the contents of the object `a` with
the result of a binary operation between the previous value of `a` and the value of `b`.



## 2.11 Increment and Decrement Operators

_Increment/decrement_ operators increment or decrement the value of the object.

| **Operator name**  | Syntax   | Overloadable  |
|:-----------------: |:-------: | :-----------: |
| pre-increment      | `++a`    | Yes           |     
| pre-decrement      | `--a`    | Yes           |
| post-increment     | `a++`    | Yes           |
| post-decrement     | `a--`    | Yes           |


### Explanation

_Pre-increment_ and _pre-decrement_ operators increase or decrease the
value of the object and returns a reference to the result.

Post-increment and post-decrement creates a copy of the object,
increments or decrements the value of the object and returns the copy
from before the increment or decrement.

##### Built-in Prefix Operators

The prefix/suffix increment and decrement expressions have the form:

- `++expr`: prefix increment (pre-increment)

- `expr++`: suffix increment (post-increment)

- `--expr`: prefix decrement (pre-decrement)

- `expr--`: suffix decrement (post-decrement)


The operand `expr` of a built-in prefix increment or decrement operator must be a modifiable (non-const) 
value of non-boolean (since C++17) arithmetic type or pointer to completely-defined object type.

For non-boolean operands, the expression `++x` and `x++` are exactly equivalent to `x += 1` or `x = x+1`,
and the expression `--x` and `x--` are exactly equivalent to `x -= 1` or `x = x-1`, 
that is, the prefix increment or decrement is a value expression that identifies the modified operand.

> 
> 
> `++x` means first increase the value of `x` by `1` and then use it. 
> whereas `x++` means first use the value of `x` and then increment it's value by `1`. 
> 
>> both `printf` statements are separate not one after other.


All arithmetic conversion rules and pointer arithmetic rules defined for arithmetic operators apply and 
determine the implicit conversion (if any) applied to the operand as well as the return type of the 
expression.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int n1 = 1;
    int n2 = ++n1;
    int n3 = ++ ++n1;
    int n4 = n1++;
    // int n5 = n1++ ++; // error
    // int n6 = n1 + ++n1; // undefined behavior
    cout << "n1 = " << n1 << '\n' << "n2 = " << n2 << '\n' << "n3 = " << n3 << '\n' << "n4 = " << n4 << '\n';
}
```

##### Output:

```text
n1 = 5
n2 = 2
n3 = 4
n4 = 4
```

## 2.12 Numeric Type Conversions

If an integral and a floating point variable or constant are mixed in an operation, 
the integral value is changed temporarily to its equivalent floating point representation before the operation is 
executed. 
This automatic conversion of an integral value to a floating point value is called _type coercion_.
Type coercion also occurs when a floating point value is assigned to an integral variable. 
Coercion from an integer to a floating point is _exact_. 
Although the two values are represented differently in memory, both representations are exact. 
However, when a floating point value is coerced into an integral value, the fractional part is truncated.


Type changes can be made explicit by placing the value to be changed in parentheses and placing the name of the new 
type before it. This is called _type casting_ or _type conversion_. 

For example:

`int value = 10.66;`, `int value = int(10.66);` and `int value = (int)10.66;` produce the same result `10`.

<br>

> #### 1.0 can be coerced into 1, but what about 1.5? Is it coerced into 1 or 2?
>
> when a floating point value is coerced into an integral value, loss of information occurs unless the floating point value is a whole number.
>
> For example, `int value = 14.0;` and `int value = 14.37;` produce the same result `14`.


In summary, we have *explicit* and *implicit* data type conversion.


- Type coercion is the implicit (automatic) conversion of a value from one data type to another.

- Type casting is The explicit conversion of a value from one data type to another; also called *type conversion*.


Conversion function is declared like a non-static member function or member function template 
with no parameters, no explicit return type, and with the name of the form:



- #### 1. operator conversion-type-id 
    
    > Declares a user-defined conversion function that participates in **all implicit and explicit** conversions.

## 2.13 Software Development Process

In software engineering, a _software development process_ is the process of dividing software development work into 
distinct phases to improve design, product management, and project management. 
It is also known as a _software development life cycle_ (SDLC). 
The methodology may include the pre-definition of specific deliverables and artifacts that are
created and completed by a project team to develop or maintain an application.

Most modern development processes can be vaguely described as agile.
Other methodologies include waterfall, prototyping, iterative and
incremental development, spiral development, rapid application
development, and extreme programming. 

Some methodologies are sometimes known as software development life 
cycle (SDLC) methodologies, though this term could also be used more generally to refer to any methodology.

A life-cycle "model" is sometimes considered a more general term for a
category of methodologies and a software development "process" a more
specific term to refer to a specific process chosen by a specific
organization.

[citation needed] 

For example, there are many specific software development 
processes that fit the spiral life-cycle model. 
The field is often considered a subset of the systems development life cycle.



## 2.14 Common Errors

-   **TypeError**: Type conversion

-   **ValueError**: Trying to change the value of a constant variable

-   **LogicalError**: Lack of using parentheses and getting the wrong Boolean expression

-   **SyntaxError**: Forgetting `;` at the end of the lines that is needed

-   **VariableError**: Inappropriate variable initialization



## 2.15 Chapter Summary
 
All in all, now we know how a simple C++ program looks like. Also, we
know how to declare variables, get them from user, and how to write
expressions using them and operators.
